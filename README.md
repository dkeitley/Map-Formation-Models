# Introduction

The aim of this repository is to provide Jupyter notebooks for two key
models of neural map formation (Willshaw and von der Malsburg, 1976;
1979).  Both models have been implemented in Python, and one in Julia.

They have also been designed to run on the mybinder service (in beta as
of August 2017).  Please use the following links to run the models:

[Neural activity model (julia)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/dkeitley/Map-Formation-Models/julia)
[Marker induction model 1979, 2006 and neural activity model (python)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/dkeitley/Map-Formation-Models/master)

Note that the beta mybinder service may not always be up.
