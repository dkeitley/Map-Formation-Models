# Introduction

The aim of this repository is to provide Jupyter notebooks for two key
models of neural map formation (Willshaw and von der Malsburg, 1976;
1979).  Both models have been implemented in Python, and one in Julia.

They have also been designed to run on the mybinder service (in beta as
of August 2017).  Please use the following link to run the models:

Note that the beta mybinder service may not always be up.

## Acknowledgments

This project was completed under the supervision of Dr Stephen Eglen at the University of Cambridge. We are grateful to the BBSRC for financially supporting this project through a Research Experience Placement scheme (DTP reference BB/M011194/1).  This work follows on from earlier implementations by [George Baxter](https://github.com/geobax/correlated_activity_76) and [Tom Bland](https://github.com/tsmbland/RetinotopicMaps) as part of their part III Systems Biology projects. I would like to thank Stephen for his support and guidance throughout the project and for making my research placement possible.
